# Pet-website
A website that allows the user to search through a list of pets via PHP and MySQL

This is the "Styled" experimental branch, which will always look prettier, but will be less functional, when proper functionality is added/fixed this will be merged into master.

Currently, on this branch you would search as normal, but then need to click "view all" or scroll down to see the results. This is planned to be fixed soon.
